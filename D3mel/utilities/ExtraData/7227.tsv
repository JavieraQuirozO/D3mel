Exists as a double back-to-back homotrimeric ring which encircles double-stranded DNA and slides spontaneously across it. Loaded onto at template-primer junctions synthesized on unwound DNA during S phase in an ATP-dependent process by replication factor C (CPX-472), where it recruits replicative DNA polymerases and stimulates their activity. The process of chromatin assembly is tightly coupled to DNA replication or repair and the double homotrimer allows DNA polymerase delta to binds to one homotrimer whilst the chromatin assembly factor-1 CNOT7 binds to the other (By similarity).	The homotrimer weighs approximately 100kDa, the double homotrimer 200kDa. The inner cavity of the protein ring has a diameter of about 30 A. The inner surface of the ring has a positive electrostatic potential with as many as 10 positively charged amino acids per subunit protruding from alpha helices inward into the central cavity.

The Arp2/3 complex appears to bind VCA and an existing actin filament in a cooperative manner. Upon activation, Arp2 and Arp3 move into the side-by-side arrangement of consecutive actin subunits along the short pitch helical axis of an actin filament, mimicking a filamentous actin dimer and creating a template for new filament assembly.

The Mediator complex is also targeted by sequence-specific, DNA-binding transcription factors and appears to regulate RNAPII at both the initiation and elongation stages of transcription. The Mediator complex, having a compact conformation in its free form, is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and unfolds to an extended conformation and partially surrounds RNAPII specifically interacting with the unphosphorylated form of its C-terminal domain. The Mediator complex dissociates from the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme and stays at the promoter when transcriptional elongation begins. Reversibly associates with the CKM complex (CPX-7701). Mediator lacking the CKM complex has a stimulatory effect on basal transcription. In contrast, Mediator containing the sub-complex represses basal transcription.	Organized into three sub-modules, termed Head, Middle and Tail which form self-contained segments of the Mediator structure connected by relatively small interfaces. The Mediator head module contains MED6, MED8, MED11, MED17, MED18, MED20, MED22, MED27, MED28, MED29 AND MED30 the middle module contains MED1, MED4, MED7, MED9, MED10, MED19,MED21, MED26 AND MED31, and the tail module contains MED23, MED24, MED25, MED14, MED15 and MED16.

Upon exchange of GDP for GTP (catalysed by SEC12), SAR1 exposes an N-terminal amphipathic helix that inserts into the outer ER membrane leaflet, promoting curvature. SAR1 recruits SEC23/24 to the membrane to form the inner layer of the COPII coat. SEC24 binds transport cargo while SEC23 interacts with SAR1 and recruits the outer COPII components (SEC13/31) that form a cage around the vesicle by self-assembling into a polyhedron. The inner and outer proteins each form lattice structures. Both coats may help to reshape the membrane, and the inner-coat and outer-coat lattices move with respect to each other.

Orai forms a probable hexamer arranged with three-fold symmetry. Each subunit consists of four transmembrane helices (TM1- 4) and a C-terminal helical cytosolic extension of TM4 (TM4e). Six innermost TM1s are arranged practically perpendicular to the plasma membrane, forming a single narrow pore at the center. The TM2 and TM3 helices form a middle ring that encloses the pore formed by TM1, and this structure is surrounded by the outermost TM4 helices. After ER Ca2+ store depletion, Ca2+ dissociates from the EF hand and the sterile alpha motif domain of STIM1. The N-terminus of STIM1 dimerizes to drive the conformational change of the CC1 region, eliciting the release of the SOAR domain. The SOAR then associates and activates the Orai channel allowing extracellular Ca2+ to permeate by being pushed by extracellular Ca2+ and pulled by intracellular anions. 	-	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	P83094(0)|Q9U6B8(6)

Phosphorylation of SUPT5H by P-TEFb appears to trigger dissociation of NELF from Pol II, enabling Pol II reactivation and resumption of elongation.	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	P92204(0)|Q24134(0)|Q86NP2(0)|Q9Y113(0)

The NPC exclusively mediates all transport between cytoplasm and nucleus.	The nuclear pore complex has a hollow cylindrical shape with eight-fold rotational symmetry along the axis perpendicular to the nuclear envelope. The central channel of the pore has a diameter of ~60 nm diameter. The nucleoporin proteins (NUPs) assemble into several sub-complexes that form higher-order structures called spokes. Eight spokes assemble into larger modules: coaxial outer and inner rings form a symmetric core scaffold, which is connected to a membrane ring, a nuclear basket and cytoplasmic RNA export complexes. The scaffold surrounds a central channel that is formed in part by multiple intrinsically disordered Phe-Gly (FG) repeat motifs that extend from nucleoporins termed FG NUPs. These FG motifs mediate selective nucleocytoplasmic transport through specific interactions with nuclear transport factors, which carry their cognate macromolecular cargoes. There are a total of 32 repeating NUP107 subcomplexes (also known as Y subcomplex) consisting of 10 subunits, NUP37, NUP43, NUP85, NUP96, NUP107, NUP133, NUP160, SEC13, SEH1 and ELYS. They are arranged in four rings of 8 subcomplexes, 2 rings each making up the main components of the nuclear and cytoplasmic rings (NR, CR). Within each CR and NR, there are 2 rings of 8, the inner and outer rings. NRs and CRs have an inner diameter of ~84 nm. The inner ring complex (IRC) consists of NUP35, NUP93, NUP155, NUP188 and NUP205. 32 repeated units are arranged in a head-to-tail fashion into two horizontally stacked rings on each side of the NPC, thereby forming a structure composed of four overlapping rings. The trimeric NUP54-NUP58-NUP62 complex is anchored to the IRC via NUP93. The inner ring harbours the central transport channel and diffusion barrier of the NPC, preventing macromolecules larger than ~40 kDa from freely diffusing across the nuclear envelope. NUP358/RBP2, subcomplex NUP62-NUP88-NUP214, Aladin, NUP98, NUP42/CG1, GLE1 and RAE1 localize to the cytoplasmic side and contribute to the cytoplasmic filaments, whereas NUP50, NUP153 and TPR localize to the nuclear side and form the nuclear basket. Nup98 and RAE1 may occur on the cytoplasmic and nuclear side while NUP62 may occur on the cytoplasmic side and the inner channel. Subcomplex NUP62-NUP88-NUP214 also binds the IRC. NDC1, NUP210 and POM121 are transmembrane NUPs while TMEM33 (P57088) is a putative transmembrane NUP. 	-	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	A0A0B4K7J2(0)|A0A0B4K859(0)|A1YK02(0)|A1Z6H7(0)|A1Z8P9(0)|Q7JXF5(0)|Q7K0D8(0)|Q7K2X8(0)|Q8IQV9(0)|Q9GYU8(0)|Q9V3J4(0)|Q9V463(0)|Q9V466(0)|Q9V4W1(0)|Q9V6B9(0)|Q9VBU8(0)|Q9VCG4(0)|Q9VCH5(0)|Q9VCW3(0)|Q9VDV3(0)|Q9VE85(0)|Q9VFE7(0)|Q9VKJ3(0)|Q9VWE6(0)|Q9VWS2(0)|Q9VXE6(0)|Q9W1X4(0)|Q9W2E7(0)|Q9W351(0)|Q9XZ06(0)

Synthesizes precursors of mRNAs, and most snRNA and microRNAs. During a transcription cycle, Pol II, general transcription factors and the mediator complex assemble as the preinitiation complex (PIC) at the promoter. 11-15 base pairs of DNA surrounding the transcription start site are melted and the single-stranded DNA template strand of the promoter is positioned deeply within the central active site cleft of Pol II to form the open complex. After synthesis of about 30 bases of RNA, Pol II releases its contacts with the core promoter and the rest of the transcription machinery (promoter clearance) and enters the stage of transcription elongation in which it moves on the template as the transcript elongates. Pol II appears to oscillate between inactive and active conformations at each step of nucleotide addition.	Pol II is composed of mobile elements that move relative to each other. The core element with the central large cleft comprises RPB3, RBP10, RPB11, RPB12 and regions of RPB1 and RPB2 forming the active center. The clamp element (portions of RPB1, RPB2 and RPB3) is connected to the core through a set of flexible switches and moves to open and close the cleft.

Responsible for the transcription of genes encoding short non-coding RNAs, such as tRNA, 5S rRNA and U6 snRNA transcripts. Pol III machinery recognizes conserved promoter elements located within the transcribed region, generally the box A and box B sequences, which contribute to the D- and T-loops in the tRNA structure. POLR3F, POLR3G and POLR3C play a role in transcription initiation whereas the POLR3D-POLR3E heterodimer is crucial for the correct recognition of the termination signals of class III genes. POLR3K is required for RNA cleavage. Pol III initiation does not require ATP hydrolysis to open a transcription bubble to isolate and secure the template strand in the catalytic site and Pol III is capable of reinitiating transcription more rapidly on the same gene after the first transcription cycle without being released (facilitated reinitiation), resulting in a higher initiation efficiency; this appears to require an POLR3K-dependent conformational change of Pol III.

In co-translational targeting of membrane and secretory proteins, SRP recognizes signal sequences as soon as they emerge from the ribosomal polypeptide exit tunnel and binds to the ribosome-nascent chain complex (RNC), leading to retardation of peptide elongation. The SRP-RNC complex is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane by interaction with the SRP receptor (SR). SRP54 recognizes the signal sequence and interacts with the SRP receptor in a GTP-dependent manner. After docking to the membrane, the RNC is transferred to the protein-conducting channel, the translocon, and protein synthesis continues. The SRP-SR complex dissociates from the ribosome and, as a result of GTP hydrolysis, SRP and SR dissociate from each other.

The mago-Y14 complex shuttles between the nucleus, where it is loaded onto specific mRNAs, and the cytoplasm and functions in translational regulation. 	Complex formation occurs through a conserved interaction surface between PYM and the mago-Y14 heterodimer (CPX-3100). PYM binds at a surface formed by both mago and Y14. The interaction is through its N-terminal domain 58 residues, that bind as a small globular all-beta-domain to both mago and Y14, capping their heterodimerization interface. It binds at the alpha-helices of mago with extensive electrostatic interactions and at the beta2-beta3 loop of Y14 with hydrophobic interactions.

Complex formation occurs in the cytosol and requires the action of translating ribosomes on the mRNP and the ribosomally associated protein Pym (P82804, in complex CPX-3147). cdm (Imp13) binds to and releases Pym from the mago-Y14 complex. mago-Y14 shuttles between the nucleus, where it is loaded onto specific mRNAs, and the cytoplasm and functions in translational regulation. 	cdm is an all alpha-helical protein consisting of 20 consecutive helical motifs (IPR016024) which pack into a toroid. When in complex with mago-Y14, cdm has a twisted ring-like conformation, with the edge of HEAT 20 approaching the side of HEAT 1. mago-Y14 binds at the inner surface of Imp13, shifted toward the side of the ring that features the inter-repeat loops. Imp13, thus, entwines mago-Y14 with many conserved interactions, explaining why purified Imp13 and mago-Y14 can interact even across species.

Coordinates asymmetric localization of cell fate determinants with orientation of the mitotic spindle resulting in different daughter cells upon division. Localizes at the apical cortex of the neuroblast: Raps maintains, but does not initiate, Insc apically, while Insc segregates Raps asymmetrically. Requires the G protein alpha i subunit (Galphai, P20353) for partial activity resulting in the selective recruitment of Discs large 1 (Dlg1, P31007) but not Mushroom body defect (Mud, Q8IR55). This ensures that the spindle is attached to the cortex (via Dlg) before activation of spindle pulling forces by Dynein/Dynactin (via Mud). The selective recruitment of Dlg1 occurs by a steric mechanism: Insc and Mud compete for binding to the tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs, IPR019734) of Raps. Complex activity appears to be conserved. Mammalian Insc (Q1MX18) functions similar to Insc, GPSM1 (also called AGS3, Q86YR5) and GPSM2 (also called LGN, P81274) to Raps, and NuMA (Q14980) to Mud.	The N-terminal TPRs of Raps mediate interactions with Insc. RapsTPR (Raps25–406) domain consists of 17 antiparallel helices forming 8.5 TPR repeats. It folds into a cradle-shaped arch harboring the extended Insc303–340 into its inner concave surface. In such arrangement, the Raps and Insc polypeptide chains run in opposite direction, with the helical N terminus of Insc303–340 contacting the C-terminal portion of RapsTPR. Spiraling of the RapsTPR domain around Insc303–340 generates an extensive interaction surface corresponding to approximately 50% of the Insc303–340 surface area.

Prevents assembly of ribosomes at the mRNA by interfacing with a sequence-specific RNA-binding protein leading to recruitment of the CCR4 complex and consequently, reduction of the mRNA's poly(A) tail length. Required for dorso-ventral pattern formation in the embryo: liaises with Bruno (O02374) and Smaug (Q23972), which bind to oskar and nanos mRNAs, respectively, to prevent their translation before posterior localization.	Cup interacts with eIF4E as two short alpha-helices connected by a linker. The N-terminal segment of Cup includes the eIF4E consensus motif (YxxxxLsigma, where x is any residue and sigma is a hydrophobic residue) that docks at the convex surface of eIF4E, where it contacts part of the unstructured N terminus of the protein. After a linker of about 20 residues, Cup extends laterally on eIF4E, where a few, mainly hydrophobic, interactions create a specific binding surface distinct from the consensus binding site. This second helix of Cup binds in an antiparallel fashion to the outermost beta-strand on the side of eIF4E and continues with a short beta-turn that extends back toward the convex surface of the protein. Both binding sites of Cup are situated away from the mRNA 5' cap-binding pocket of eIF4E.	Heterodimer	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	P48598(1)|Q9VMA3(1)

PIWI proteins associate specifically with PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), small RNAs expressed predominantly in germlines, and silence transposable DNA elements, thus maintaining the integrity of the genome and the development of gametes. The presence of Tudor in the complex appears to be required for the quality control of transposon-derived piRNAs. Symmetric dimethylated arginines (sDMA) result from methylation of Aub by dPRMT5 (csul, Q9U6Y9) and act as binding sites for Tud domains. This complex accumulates in the P granule (meiotic nuage) of primordial germ cells where it is found in the posterior pole plasm.	Tud-repeat-domains 7-11 of subunit Tud are sufficient for binding to the symmetrically dimethylated arginines (sDMAs) found within residues 11-17 of subunit Aub. The tud domains resemble cages made up of aromatic amino acids into which sDMAs of Aub enter from the front and lower side.	Heterodimer	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	O76922(1)|P25823(1)
